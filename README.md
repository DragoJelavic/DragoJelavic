## Proud husband, doting father, and meticulous developer at Agilathon (Medable) 👨‍💻
Hello there! I'm Drago Jelavic, a passionate developer who takes pride in clean code, meticulous code reviews, and maintaining consistency in every aspect of software development. Apart from being dedicated to my craft, I find immense joy in being a loving husband and father to my little girl and a boy. 👨‍👩‍👧

## Technical Interests
With a strong affinity for technology, I am particularly drawn to frontend, backend, and full-stack development. I am always eager to dive into real production projects where I can expand my expertise in React and Node.js. Clean code and well-structured architectures are among my top priorities, as they contribute to maintainable and scalable solutions. ✨

## Constantly Upgrading Skills
I am constantly upgrading my skills to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of JavaScript. I have been immersing myself in the realms of Node.js, Typescript, and Prisma, refining my proficiency in these technologies. By staying up-to-date with the latest developments, I strive to deliver high-quality solutions that leverage the full potential of these tools. 📚

## Collaboration and Projects
I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities on the frontend, backend, or full-stack projects. Working alongside like-minded individuals who share my passion for clean code and attention to detail is something I greatly value. If you have a project in mind and believe my skills align with your requirements, feel free to reach out to me. 🤝

## Currently doing 
**"It's been far too long Drago! 🎉 Welcome back!"**

I am currently upgrading my old projects such as my final thesis paper where I built a health app that sells medical aids. ❤️‍🩹
Will also update the other projects a bit. And hopefully, start a new one... 🔜
